## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

Essentially the company wants :
- To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19, by creating a linear model.
- To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
- The months - Jan , Jul , Sep , Nov , Dec should be considered by the company as they have a higher demand as compared to other months.
- With an increase in temperature the demand also increases, hence it should keep track of the weather conditions.
- During the Winter season the demand rises, hence it should be well prepared to meet the high demand.
- Holiday time seems to be least interesting bor biking, little motavation and marketing might help here.
